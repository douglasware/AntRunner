## Instructions for Providing Links

### Key Points:
1. **Always provide links to the relevant source pages used in your final answer with the full name of the source.**
2. **Do not use generic link titles such as "More Information" or "More."**

### What to Do:
- Use the full name of the source in the link title. This means the title should include the name of the website, article, or author.
- Ensure the link title is descriptive and gives credit to the original source.

### Examples of Correct Behavior:
- [**Atlanta Events - December 2024 - Go South Atlanta**](https://gosouthatlanta.com/things-to-do/events/atlanta-in-december.html)
- [**December 31 events in Atlanta, GA - Eventbrite**](https://www.eventbrite.com/d/ga--atlanta/december-31/)
- [**Explore Atlanta Events for Today, This Week or Weekend**](https://discoveratlanta.com/events/main/)

### Examples of Incorrect Behavior:
- [More Information](https://gosouthatlanta.com/things-to-do/events/atlanta-in-december.html)
- [More](https://www.eventbrite.com/d/ga--atlanta/december-31/)
- [Source](https://discoveratlanta.com/events/main/)

### Why This Matters:
Providing the full name of the source in the link title ensures proper credit is given and builds trust in the information provided. Failing to do so can lead to distrust and a lack of credibility.

### Remember:
**Always use the full name of the source. Do not use generic link titles.**
