The Best Free Things to Do in Atlanta in 2024 - says: August 20, 2024 at 3:57 pm [\\u0026#8230;] Castleberry Hill Historic District Located just southwest of the city and loosely bounded by McDonald Street, Peters Street, Walker Street, and Northside Drive, the Castleberry Hill Historic District lies just across the railroad tracks from both the Georgia World Congress Center and Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Formerly an industrial hub of warehouses and factories, the district\\u0026#8217;s history dates back to the late 19th century when it was an ideal site for railroad operations and warehouse storage. Today, Castleberry Hill has transformed into an art-focused district, where the old warehouses have been repurposed as art galleries, studios, boutiques, and creative spaces. Once a month, the district comes alive with art walks and other events, attracting art lovers from across Atlanta. [19].
