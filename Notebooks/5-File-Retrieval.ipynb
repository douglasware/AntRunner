       "   - In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, McKesson experienced increased demand for pharmaceuticals as people stocked up on medications and personal protective equipment, leading to approximately $2 billion of incremental revenue【4:0†source】【4:3†source】.\n",

       "   - The demand for COVID-19-related products and services fluctuated throughout the pandemic, with spikes in demand during periods of increased COVID-19 cases【4:6†source】.\n",
