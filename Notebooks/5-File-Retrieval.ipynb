       "1. **Initial Impact and Fiscal 2020**:\n",
       "   - In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, McKesson experienced increased demand for pharmaceuticals and personal protective equipment (PPE) due to the pandemic, resulting in approximately $2 billion of incremental revenue. This was partially offset by higher operating expenses related to frontline employee support and remote workforce needs [McKessonMDTranscripts_Q4FY20-MCK-Corrected-Transcript.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_Q4FY20-MCK-Corrected-Transcript.md) [McKessonMDTranscripts_Q4FY20-MCK-Corrected-Transcript.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_Q4FY20-MCK-Corrected-Transcript.md) [McKessonMDTranscripts_Q4FY20-MCK-Corrected-Transcript.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_Q4FY20-MCK-Corrected-Transcript.md).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Fiscal 2021**:\n",
       "   - Throughout fiscal 2021, McKesson navigated significant uncertainties due to COVID-19. The company saw volume declines in the early part of the fiscal year, but recovery began earlier than anticipated. The distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supply kits contributed positively to results in the later part of the year [McKessonMDTranscripts_Q3FY21-MCK-Earnings-Call-Transcript_FINAL.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_Q3FY21-MCK-Earnings-Call-Transcript_FINAL.md) [McKessonMDTranscripts_MCK-Q4FY21-Transcript.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_MCK-Q4FY21-Transcript.md) [McKessonMDTranscripts_MCK-Q1FY21-Transcript.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_MCK-Q1FY21-Transcript.md) [McKessonMDTranscripts_MCK-Q4FY21-Transcript.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_MCK-Q4FY21-Transcript.md).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Fiscal 2022**:\n",
       "   - The results were influenced by the ongoing distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and tests. However, there were challenges such as a light cold and flu season and variability in COVID-19 demand, which impacted results. Despite these challenges, McKesson continued to support its customers with necessary supplies and services [McKessonMDTranscripts_220505-MCK-Q4FY22-Earnings-Call-Transcript.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_220505-MCK-Q4FY22-Earnings-Call-Transcript.md) [McKessonMDTranscripts_220505-MCK-Q4FY22-Earnings-Call-Transcript.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_220505-MCK-Q4FY22-Earnings-Call-Transcript.md) [McKessonMDTranscripts_Q3FY21-MCK-Earnings-Call-Transcript_FINAL.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_Q3FY21-MCK-Earnings-Call-Transcript_FINAL.md).\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Fiscal 2023**:\n",
       "   - The benefit from COVID-19-related activities, including vaccine distribution and test kits, started to decline compared to the previous years. The company noted a reduction in sales of COVID-19 tests and lower contributions from government contracts for vaccine distribution. However, McKesson continued to see growth in its core businesses, including primary care and specialty products [McKessonMDTranscripts_230508-MCK-Q4FY23-Earnings-Call-Transcript.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_230508-MCK-Q4FY23-Earnings-Call-Transcript.md) [McKessonMDTranscripts_230508-MCK-Q4FY23-Earnings-Call-Transcript.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_230508-MCK-Q4FY23-Earnings-Call-Transcript.md) [McKessonMDTranscripts_220803-MCK-Q1FY23-Earnings-Call-Transcript.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_220803-MCK-Q1FY23-Earnings-Call-Transcript.md).\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, McKesson's response to the pandemic involved adapting to fluctuating demand, supporting healthcare providers with essential supplies, and leveraging its distribution capabilities to aid in vaccine distribution. The impact of COVID-19 evolved from initial demand spikes and logistical challenges to more stable contributions from ongoing pandemic-related activities, with a gradual return to focusing on core business growth."
