       "\n",
       "2. **Adapting to Pandemic Challenges (FY2021)**\n",
       "   - The first quarter of FY2021 was severely impacted by global lockdowns, resulting in lower prescription volumes and primary care patient visits. However, as restrictions eased, demand began to recover sooner than expected, particularly in the Medical-Surgical and Specialty businesses【4:17†source】.\n",
       "   - The distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supply kits provided significant benefits, contributing to increased adjusted earnings per diluted share by 18% in Q4 FY2021【4:10†source】【4:4†source】.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Continued Variability and Vaccine Distribution (FY2022)**\n",
       "   - FY2022 saw fluctuations in demand for COVID-19-related products and services, with peaks during spikes in cases such as the Omicron variant surge in January【4:5†source】.\n",
       "   - COVID-19 vaccine distribution and testing continued to contribute to earnings, though these contributions were expected to be materially lower in FY2023【4:5†source】【4:12†source】.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Declining COVID-19 Contributions (FY2023)**\n",
       "   - By FY2023, the impact of COVID-19 on McKesson's results had diminished compared to prior years. The contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution and related services decreased, leading to a decline in operating profit in segments like Medical-Surgical Solutions【4:6†source】.\n",

       "The impact of COVID-19 on McKesson's results over time has varied significantly. Here's an overview of the key impacts observed across different fiscal years and quarters:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Initial Impact and Incremental Revenue (FY2020)**\n",
       "   - In FY2020, McKesson experienced a surge in demand as customers stocked up on pharmaceuticals and personal protective equipment (PPE). This led to approximately $2 billion in incremental revenue in the fourth quarter of FY2020 [McKessonMDTranscripts_230508-MCK-Q4FY23-Earnings-Call-Transcript.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_230508-MCK-Q4FY23-Earnings-Call-Transcript.md) [McKessonMDTranscripts_Q4FY20-MCK-Corrected-Transcript.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_Q4FY20-MCK-Corrected-Transcript.md) [McKessonMDTranscripts_Q4FY20-MCK-Corrected-Transcript.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_Q4FY20-MCK-Corrected-Transcript.md).\n",
       "   - The pandemic caused increased expenses, including investments in frontline employees and remote work infrastructure, adding approximately $45 million in one-time adjusted operating expenses in Q4 FY2020 [McKessonMDTranscripts_Q4FY20-MCK-Corrected-Transcript.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_Q4FY20-MCK-Corrected-Transcript.md).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Adapting to Pandemic Challenges (FY2021)**\n",
       "   - The first quarter of FY2021 was severely impacted by global lockdowns, resulting in lower prescription volumes and primary care patient visits. However, as restrictions eased, demand began to recover sooner than expected, particularly in the Medical-Surgical and Specialty businesses [McKessonMDTranscripts_MCK-Q1FY21-Transcript.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_MCK-Q1FY21-Transcript.md).\n",
       "   - The distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supply kits provided significant benefits, contributing to increased adjusted earnings per diluted share by 18% in Q4 FY2021 [McKessonMDTranscripts_MCK-Q4FY21-Transcript.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_MCK-Q4FY21-Transcript.md) [McKessonMDTranscripts_MCK-Q4FY21-Transcript.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_MCK-Q4FY21-Transcript.md).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Continued Variability and Vaccine Distribution (FY2022)**\n",
       "   - FY2022 saw fluctuations in demand for COVID-19-related products and services, with peaks during spikes in cases such as the Omicron variant surge in January [McKessonMDTranscripts_220505-MCK-Q4FY22-Earnings-Call-Transcript.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_220505-MCK-Q4FY22-Earnings-Call-Transcript.md).\n",
       "   - COVID-19 vaccine distribution and testing continued to contribute to earnings, though these contributions were expected to be materially lower in FY2023 [McKessonMDTranscripts_220505-MCK-Q4FY22-Earnings-Call-Transcript.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_220505-MCK-Q4FY22-Earnings-Call-Transcript.md) [McKessonMDTranscripts_220803-MCK-Q1FY23-Earnings-Call-Transcript.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_220803-MCK-Q1FY23-Earnings-Call-Transcript.md).\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Declining COVID-19 Contributions (FY2023)**\n",
       "   - By FY2023, the impact of COVID-19 on McKesson's results had diminished compared to prior years. The contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution and related services decreased, leading to a decline in operating profit in segments like Medical-Surgical Solutions [McKessonMDTranscripts_230508-MCK-Q4FY23-Earnings-Call-Transcript.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_230508-MCK-Q4FY23-Earnings-Call-Transcript.md).\n",
       "   - Despite lower COVID-19-related contributions, the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment still delivered operating profit growth when excluding the impact of vaccine distribution [McKessonMDTranscripts_230508-MCK-Q4FY23-Earnings-Call-Transcript.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_230508-MCK-Q4FY23-Earnings-Call-Transcript.md).\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, McKesson's financial performance has been significantly influenced by the varying demand for COVID-19-related products and services, with initial boosts in revenue and subsequent fluctuations as the pandemic evolved. The company's ability to adapt and leverage its distribution capabilities played a crucial role in navigating these challenges."
