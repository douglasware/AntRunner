      "\n",
      "1. **Initial Impact and Demand Surge (Q4 FY20)**:\n",
      "   - The onset of the pandemic led to increased demand for pharmaceuticals, personal protective equipment (PPE), and other medical supplies. This resulted in approximately $2 billion of incremental revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, primarily driven by higher customer demand for pharmaceuticals【4:0†source】【4:13†source】.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Operational Adjustments and Early Pandemic Challenges (Q1 FY21)**:\n",
      "   - In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, prescription transaction volumes were uneven, and oncology visits were significantly impacted but later improved. Revenues from the Echo business in the UK grew over 300% from pre-pandemic levels due to increased demand for digital healthcare solutions【4:9†source】.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Vaccine Distribution and Testing Demand (Q3 FY21)**:\n",
      "   - McKesson played a crucial role in distributing COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supply kits for the US government. The company recognized benefits from these activities, which contributed to adjusted earnings and operating profit growth【4:12†source】【4:17†source】.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Sustained Impact and Variability (Q4 FY21)**:\n",
      "   - The impact of COVID-19 continued to demonstrate variability, with demand for COVID-19-related products and services fluctuating. McKesson experienced increased demand for COVID-19 tests and PPE, contributing to revenue growth in the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment【4:16†source】.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Decline in COVID-19-Related Contributions (FY22)**:\n",
      "   - In fiscal 2022, the contributions from COVID-19 tests and vaccine distribution began to decline. The company experienced a 60% increase in COVID-19 test demand in January due to the Omicron variant, followed by a 90% decrease in test volumes by March【4:6†source】【4:7†source】.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Ongoing Impact and Future Outlook (Q4 FY23)**:\n",
      "   - For the full year of fiscal 2023, COVID-19-related items provided a benefit of $216 million, compared to $371 million in fiscal 2022. The company's results were impacted by lower sales of COVID-19 tests and lower contributions from the kitting, storage, and distribution of ancillary supplies【4:0†source】【4:8†source】.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, McKesson's financial performance was significantly influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, with initial surges in demand for pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, followed by contributions from vaccine distribution and testing. As the pandemic progressed, the variability in demand for COVID-19-related products and services continued to impact the company's results.\r\n"
