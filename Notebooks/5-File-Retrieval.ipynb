       "1. **Fiscal 2020**:\n",
       "   - The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic led to increased demand for pharmaceuticals and personal protective equipment (PPE), resulting in approximately $2 billion of incremental revenue in the fourth quarter【4:0†source】【4:3†source】.\n",
       "   - Adjusted gross profit for the fourth quarter was positively impacted by $65 million due to these increased volumes, although there were also higher operating expenses related to supporting frontline employees and a remote workforce【4:3†source】.\n",
       "   - The increased demand and consumer behavior changes provided a net tailwind to the fourth quarter revenue results【4:3†source】.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Fiscal 2021**:\n",
       "   - The first half of fiscal 2021 was challenging due to the pandemic, with expectations of gradual improvement in the second half【4:0†source】【4:4†source】.\n",
       "   - McKesson experienced increased demand for COVID-19 tests and uneven levels of demand for PPE throughout the fiscal year【4:1†source】.\n",
       "   - The company played a significant role in distributing COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supply kits, which contributed to the financial results in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical segments【4:4†source】【4:17†source】.\n",
       "   - There was also a benefit from unplanned gains on equity investments within the McKesson Ventures portfolio【4:11†source】.\n",
       "   - Despite the challenges, McKesson's core business remained fundamentally sound, and the company increased its fiscal year 2021 guidance due to the execution of vaccine and kitting programs【4:12†source】【4:15†source】.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Fiscal 2022**:\n",
       "   - The demand for COVID-19-related products fluctuated, with a spike in COVID-19 tests in January 2022 due to the Omicron variant, followed by a decline in February and March【4:6†source】.\n",
       "   - The company recognized lower contributions from the U.S. government's COVID-19 programs, but these were partially offset by commercial COVID-19 distribution【4:14†source】.\n",
       "   - For the full year, COVID-19-related items provided a benefit of $216 million, compared to $371 million in fiscal 2022【4:2†source】.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Fiscal 2023**:\n",
       "   - Lower sales of COVID-19 tests and lower contributions from kitting, storage, and distribution of ancillary supplies to the U.S. government's COVID-19 program impacted the financial results【4:8†source】.\n",
       "   - The company's International segment saw a decrease in revenues and operating profit due to the completed divestitures within European businesses【4:8†source】.\n",

       "\n",
       "1. **Fiscal 2020**:\n",
       "   - The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic led to increased demand for pharmaceuticals and personal protective equipment (PPE), resulting in approximately $2 billion of incremental revenue in the fourth quarter [McKessonMDTranscripts_Q4FY20-MCK-Corrected-Transcript.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_Q4FY20-MCK-Corrected-Transcript.md) [McKessonMDTranscripts_Q4FY20-MCK-Corrected-Transcript.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_Q4FY20-MCK-Corrected-Transcript.md).\n",
       "   - Adjusted gross profit for the fourth quarter was positively impacted by $65 million due to these increased volumes, although there were also higher operating expenses related to supporting frontline employees and a remote workforce [McKessonMDTranscripts_Q4FY20-MCK-Corrected-Transcript.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_Q4FY20-MCK-Corrected-Transcript.md).\n",
       "   - The increased demand and consumer behavior changes provided a net tailwind to the fourth quarter revenue results [McKessonMDTranscripts_Q4FY20-MCK-Corrected-Transcript.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_Q4FY20-MCK-Corrected-Transcript.md).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Fiscal 2021**:\n",
       "   - The first half of fiscal 2021 was challenging due to the pandemic, with expectations of gradual improvement in the second half [McKessonMDTranscripts_Q4FY20-MCK-Corrected-Transcript.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_Q4FY20-MCK-Corrected-Transcript.md) [McKessonMDTranscripts_MCK-Q4FY21-Transcript.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_MCK-Q4FY21-Transcript.md).\n",

       "   - The company played a significant role in distributing COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supply kits, which contributed to the financial results in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical segments [McKessonMDTranscripts_MCK-Q4FY21-Transcript.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_MCK-Q4FY21-Transcript.md) [McKessonMDTranscripts_MCK-Q4FY21-Transcript.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_MCK-Q4FY21-Transcript.md).\n",

       "   - Despite the challenges, McKesson's core business remained fundamentally sound, and the company increased its fiscal year 2021 guidance due to the execution of vaccine and kitting programs [McKessonMDTranscripts_Q3FY21-MCK-Earnings-Call-Transcript_FINAL.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_Q3FY21-MCK-Earnings-Call-Transcript_FINAL.md) [McKessonMDTranscripts_Q3FY21-MCK-Earnings-Call-Transcript_FINAL.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_Q3FY21-MCK-Earnings-Call-Transcript_FINAL.md).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Fiscal 2022**:\n",
       "   - The demand for COVID-19-related products fluctuated, with a spike in COVID-19 tests in January 2022 due to the Omicron variant, followed by a decline in February and March [McKessonMDTranscripts_220505-MCK-Q4FY22-Earnings-Call-Transcript.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_220505-MCK-Q4FY22-Earnings-Call-Transcript.md).\n",
       "   - The company recognized lower contributions from the U.S. government's COVID-19 programs, but these were partially offset by commercial COVID-19 distribution [McKessonMDTranscripts_MCK-Q3-FY24-Earnings-Transcript.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_MCK-Q3-FY24-Earnings-Transcript.md).\n",
       "   - For the full year, COVID-19-related items provided a benefit of $216 million, compared to $371 million in fiscal 2022 [McKessonMDTranscripts_230508-MCK-Q4FY23-Earnings-Call-Transcript.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_230508-MCK-Q4FY23-Earnings-Call-Transcript.md).\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Fiscal 2023**:\n",

       "   - The contract with the U.S. government for COVID-19 vaccine distribution provided a benefit of $149 million for the full year, down from $186 million in fiscal 2022 [McKessonMDTranscripts_230508-MCK-Q4FY23-Earnings-Call-Transcript.md](McKessonMDTranscripts_230508-MCK-Q4FY23-Earnings-Call-Transcript.md).\n",
