# AntRunner.Toolcalling

This library fully decouples the AntRunner Assistant Definitions and tool calling support from the Assistants API.

You can use it with any dotnet library that supports inference with the Open AI Chat Completions API.

See \AntRunner\AntRunner.Chat\AntRunner.Chat\ChatRunner.cs for example usage.
