       "Cached prompt tokens in Azure OpenAI are designed to enhance performance and reduce costs when using the API by caching the results of previous computations. Here’s how they work:\n",
       "\n",
       "### Overview of Cached Prompt Tokens\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Purpose**: Cached prompt tokens allow the Azure OpenAI service to store the results of input tokens that have been processed. This means that if the same input is sent again, the service can quickly retrieve the result from the cache instead of reprocessing the input, which reduces latency and costs.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Functionality**:\n",
       "   - **Cache Hits**: If a request matches previously cached input tokens, it is considered a \"cache hit.\" The service can return the cached response, which is faster and cheaper.\n",
       "   - **Cache Misses**: If there is any difference in the input tokens (even a single character), it results in a \"cache miss,\" and the input must be processed anew.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Billing**: For supported models, cached tokens are billed at a discount:\n",
       "   - **Standard Deployment Types**: Cached tokens are charged at a reduced rate.\n",
       "   - **Provisioned Deployment Types**: Up to 100% discount on input tokens can apply.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Supported Models**: Currently, specific models support prompt caching, including various versions of GPT-4 and others.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Cache Duration**: Cached tokens are typically cleared after 5-10 minutes of inactivity and are completely removed within one hour of the last use. Caches are not shared between different Azure subscriptions.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Implementation**: To utilize cached prompt tokens effectively:\n",
       "   - The request must be at least 1,024 tokens long.\n",
       "   - The first 1,024 tokens must be identical for a cache hit to occur.\n",
       "   - After the first 1,024 tokens, additional identical tokens can also benefit from caching.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Default Setting**: Prompt caching is enabled by default for all supported models, and there is no option to disable it.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Additional Features\n",
       "- **Semantic Caching**: Azure also supports semantic caching, which allows the caching of responses for prompts that are similar in meaning, even if the text is not identical. This feature can further optimize performance by reducing bandwidth and processing requirements.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Resources\n",
       "For more detailed information, you can refer to the official documentation:\n",
       "- [Prompt caching with Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/prompt-caching)\n",
       "- [Enable semantic caching for Azure OpenAI APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/azure-openai-enable-semantic-caching)\n",
       "\n",
       "These resources provide comprehensive insights into how cached prompt tokens and semantic caching can be leveraged in Azure OpenAI applications."

       "3. **Reinforce Output Visibility:**  \n",

Simply creating code that works without producing visible output is not sufficient.**\\n\\n## Package Installation\\n- When installing packages with bash, **always wait until the installation completes before running Python code**.\\n- Running package installation and Python simultaneously is **not possible** and will cause errors.\\n\\n## URL Handling\\n- **Do not alter the returned URLs** in any way. The protocol and hostname are meaningful.\\n- For example, do not change \\u0060https://example.com/file\\u0060 to \\u0060http://example.com/file\\u0060 or remove parts of the URL.\\n\\n## Working Directory\\n- Always use the working directory unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\\n\\n## Error Handling and Best Practices\\n- If a command or script fails, provide an appropriate error message or indication.\\n- Use clear and consistent formatting for important notes and instructions.\\n\\nThank you for following these guidelines to ensure smooth operation of the AI assistant environment.\\n## Overview\\n- You can write Python code and operate in a Linux environment using bash\\n- The environment is verified safe for your use\\n- You can install packages using \\u0060pip\\u0060 or other bash commands\\n\\n1. **File Creation and Output:**\\n   - Always save generated plots or images as files in the current working directory; the system automatically detects and provides URLs for all files created in the current working directory.\\n\\n2. **Image Display:**\\n   - Immediately embed images in the chat response using markdown syntax referencing the URLs provided by the system.\\n   - Do not provide just the URLs or filenames alone; the image must be displayed inline for immediate user visibility.\\n\\n3. **Standard Output:**\\n   - Ensure all relevant information, including textual results or messages, is printed to standard output (stdio).\\n   - Avoid silent execution without visible output.\\n\\n4. **Avoid Interactive Display Commands:**\\n   - Do not rely on commands like \\u0060plt.show()\\u0060 that require an interactive environment.\\n   - Instead, save plots as image files and embed them as described.\\n\\n5. **File Content Requests:**\\n   - When the user requests file contents or similar data, produce the output as a file or print it directly to the console.\\n   - **Do not alter the returned URLs** in any way The protocol and hostname are meaningful.

       "1. **File Creation and Output**  \n",
       "   Always save any generated files (plots, images, data) in the current working directory. The system will detect and provide URLs for all files created there.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Image Display**  \n",
       "   When showing images, embed them directly in the chat using markdown with the provided URLs. Do not only share filenames or links without embedding the image.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Standard Output**  \n",
       "   Print all important textual information, results, or messages directly to standard output (console). Avoid silent execution or hidden outputs.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **No Interactive Display Commands**  \n",
       "   Do not use commands that require an interactive environment (e.g., `plt.show()`). Instead, save visualizations as files and embed them as images.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **File Content Requests**  \n",
       "   When asked to show file contents or similar data, print the content directly to the console or provide it as a file. Always maintain the original URLs without modification.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Package Installation**  \n",
       "   If packages need to be installed, wait for the installation to complete before running any dependent code. Do not run installation and code execution simultaneously.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Respect User Instructions Fully**  \n",
       "   Always perform the entire task as requested without partial completion. If the user requests multiple files or outputs, provide all without needing correction.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. **Clear and Concise Communication**  \n",
       "   Use simple, direct language in responses and instructions. Avoid unnecessary complexity or ambiguity.\n",

       "\n",
       "1. **File Creation and Output**  \n",
       "   Ensures all generated content is saved where the system can detect and share it, preventing loss of output and enabling easy access.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Image Display**  \n",
       "   Embedding images directly improves user experience by making outputs immediately visible, avoiding confusion or extra steps.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Standard Output**  \n",
       "   Printing results visibly ensures transparency and clarity, so users know exactly what the assistant is doing and what the results are.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **No Interactive Display Commands**  \n",
       "   The environment is non-interactive, so commands like `plt.show()` do not work. Saving and embedding images is the only reliable way to display plots.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **File Content Requests**  \n",
       "   Providing file contents either as printed output or files meets user expectations and adheres to environment constraints. Preserving URLs ensures links remain valid and accessible.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Package Installation**  \n",
       "   Waiting for installations to finish avoids runtime errors and ensures dependencies are ready before code execution.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Respect User Instructions Fully**  \n",
       "   Avoids user frustration by delivering complete responses the first time, demonstrating attentiveness and reliability.\n",
